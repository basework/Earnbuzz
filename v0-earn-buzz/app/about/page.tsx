        <div className="space-y-5 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Tivexx9ja is a fast-rising Nigerian digital platform built to empower individuals through financial growth, earning opportunities, and access to smart online services — all in one place.  
            Our goal is simple: to help Nigerians earn, grow, and live better in this tough economy.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Tivexx9ja, we provide users with access to a sustainable earning system through referrals, simple online tasks, and digital tools that pay real value for your effort.  
            Every user matters to us — and that’s why our team works daily to stabilize the platform, improve performance, and roll out better features.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users should note that our platform has gained massive attention, and we are actively maintaining the database to keep it fast and stable.  
            Referral bonuses and referral counts take up to 15 minutes to display (sometimes faster). Withdrawals are processed within 5–10 minutes.  
            Please avoid using <strong>Opay</strong> for verification or transactions — every other Nigerian bank is supported.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700">What You Can Do on Tivexx9ja</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Earn from daily tasks and referrals</li>
            <li>Withdraw earnings instantly anytime, any day</li>
            <li>Access exclusive bonuses through consistent referrals</li>
            <li>Upgrade your account for unlimited withdrawals without referrals</li>
            <li>Get 24/7 active support through our Telegram channel</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We’ve recently added a new <strong>“Withdraw Without Referral”</strong> toggle button that lets users withdraw earnings without referring anyone — simply upgrade your account to unlock this feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, those who prefer to refer can keep inviting friends — some users have referred over 100, 200, even 300 people.  
            The more you refer, the higher your earnings and the greater your access to upcoming features.
          </p>

          <p className="font-medium text-green-800">
            Tivexx9ja is not just a platform — it’s a movement built to help Nigerians earn online, support one another, and make digital income possible for everyone.
